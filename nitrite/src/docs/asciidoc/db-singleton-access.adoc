=== Tips
In Android Nitrite DB might fail if it's being opened by two processes at the same time.
The solution to that problem is to apply the classic singleton design pattern.
The idea is to make sure only one process is accessing the DB file, and subsequent requests are using the already built Nitrite DB object
and not try to open the DB file again if it has already been opened in the same context.
