Replication is a secured operation. There are two sets of credentials needed to
successfully perform replication.

1. The client credential
2. The user credential

Client credential is required to create user credentials in the DataGate server.
The user credential is required to perform several operations during the replication
life cycle. Once a user credential is created it can be used for replication.

A client credential can be created using the DataGate portal. Once it is created,
an app can use that client credential to create further users. Those users will take
part in the replication.

NOTE: The user credential has *USER* authority and a client credential has *CLIENT*
authority.
