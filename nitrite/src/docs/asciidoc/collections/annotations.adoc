Nitrite provides a set of annotations for entity objects while using it in ObjectRepository. The
annotations are to let Nitrite knows about various information about the ObjectRepository while
constructing it. It also helps to reduce some boilerplate code.

.Example
[source,java]
--
// Employee class
@Indices({
        @Index(value = "joinDate", type = IndexType.NonUnique),
        @Index(value = "name", type = IndexType.Unique)
})
public class Employee implements Serializable {
    @Id
    private long empId;

    private Date joinDate;

    private String name;

    private String address;

    // ... public getters and setters
}

`Index` annotation is to let Nitrite knows about the field which will be indexed. `Id` annotation
is to mark a field as id field. This id field is used to uniquely identify an object inside an
ObjectRepository. More on these annotations will be discussed later.
