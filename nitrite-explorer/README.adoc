= Nitrite Explorer

Nitrite explorer is a javafx application to view the data of
a nitrite database file.

It is a readonly explorer of the database, but one cannot modify
any data within the database using this tool to prevent data corruption.

To run it use the following command:

[source,bash]
--
java -jar nitrite-explorer-{version}.jar
--
